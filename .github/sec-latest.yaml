    Title: 'openssl: RFC7250 handshakes with unauthenticated servers don''t abort as expected'
    Description: |-
      Issue summary: Clients using RFC7250 Raw Public Keys (RPKs) to authenticate a
      server may fail to notice that the server was not authenticated, because
      handshakes don't abort as expected when the SSL_VERIFY_PEER verification mode
      is set.

      Impact summary: TLS and DTLS connections using raw public keys may be
      vulnerable to man-in-middle attacks when server authentication failure is not
      detected by clients.

      RPKs are disabled by default in both TLS clients and TLS servers.  The issue
      only arises when TLS clients explicitly enable RPK use by the server, and the
      server, likewise, enables sending of an RPK instead of an X.509 certificate
      chain.  The affected clients are those that then rely on the handshake to
      fail when the server's RPK fails to match one of the expected public keys,
      by setting the verification mode to SSL_VERIFY_PEER.

      Clients that enable server-side raw public keys can still find out that raw
      public key verification failed by calling SSL_get_verify_result(), and those
      that do, and take appropriate action, are not affected.  This issue was
      introduced in the initial implementation of RPK support in OpenSSL 3.2.

      The FIPS modules in 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

    Title: 'openssl: Timing side-channel in ECDSA signature computation'
    Description: |-
      Issue summary: A timing side-channel which could potentially allow recovering
      the private key exists in the ECDSA signature computation.

      Impact summary: A timing side-channel in ECDSA signature computations
      could allow recovering the private key by an attacker. However, measuring
      the timing would require either local access to the signing application or
      a very fast network connection with low latency.

      There is a timing signal of around 300 nanoseconds when the top word of
      the inverted ECDSA nonce value is zero. This can happen with significant
      probability only for some of the supported elliptic curves. In particular
      the NIST P-521 curve is affected. To be able to measure this leak, the attacker
      process must either be located in the same physical computer or must
      have a very fast network connection with low latency. For that reason
      the severity of this vulnerability is Low.

    Title: 'openssl: RFC7250 handshakes with unauthenticated servers don''t abort as expected'
    Description: |-
      Issue summary: Clients using RFC7250 Raw Public Keys (RPKs) to authenticate a
      server may fail to notice that the server was not authenticated, because
      handshakes don't abort as expected when the SSL_VERIFY_PEER verification mode
      is set.

      Impact summary: TLS and DTLS connections using raw public keys may be
      vulnerable to man-in-middle attacks when server authentication failure is not
      detected by clients.

      RPKs are disabled by default in both TLS clients and TLS servers.  The issue
      only arises when TLS clients explicitly enable RPK use by the server, and the
      server, likewise, enables sending of an RPK instead of an X.509 certificate
      chain.  The affected clients are those that then rely on the handshake to
      fail when the server's RPK fails to match one of the expected public keys,
      by setting the verification mode to SSL_VERIFY_PEER.

      Clients that enable server-side raw public keys can still find out that raw
      public key verification failed by calling SSL_get_verify_result(), and those
      that do, and take appropriate action, are not affected.  This issue was
      introduced in the initial implementation of RPK support in OpenSSL 3.2.

      The FIPS modules in 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

    Title: 'openssl: Timing side-channel in ECDSA signature computation'
    Description: |-
      Issue summary: A timing side-channel which could potentially allow recovering
      the private key exists in the ECDSA signature computation.

      Impact summary: A timing side-channel in ECDSA signature computations
      could allow recovering the private key by an attacker. However, measuring
      the timing would require either local access to the signing application or
      a very fast network connection with low latency.

      There is a timing signal of around 300 nanoseconds when the top word of
      the inverted ECDSA nonce value is zero. This can happen with significant
      probability only for some of the supported elliptic curves. In particular
      the NIST P-521 curve is affected. To be able to measure this leak, the attacker
      process must either be located in the same physical computer or must
      have a very fast network connection with low latency. For that reason
      the severity of this vulnerability is Low.
