    Title: AES-SIV cipher implementation contains a bug that causes it to ignore empty associated data entries
    Description: |-
      Issue summary: The AES-SIV cipher implementation contains a bug that causes
      it to ignore empty associated data entries which are unauthenticated as
      a consequence.

      Impact summary: Applications that use the AES-SIV algorithm and want to
      authenticate empty data entries as associated data can be mislead by removing
      adding or reordering such empty entries as these are ignored by the OpenSSL
      implementation. We are currently unaware of any such applications.

      The AES-SIV algorithm allows for authentication of multiple associated
      data entries along with the encryption. To authenticate empty data the
      application has to call EVP_EncryptUpdate() (or EVP_CipherUpdate()) with
      NULL pointer as the output buffer and 0 as the input buffer length.
      The AES-SIV implementation in OpenSSL just returns success for such a call
      instead of performing the associated data authentication operation.
      The empty data thus will not be authenticated.

      As this issue does not affect non-empty associated data authentication and
      we expect it to be rare for an application to use empty associated data
      entries this is qualified as Low severity issue.

    Title: Excessive time spent checking DH keys and parameters
    Description: |-
      Issue summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow.

      Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_check(), DH_check_ex()
      or EVP_PKEY_param_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long
      delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained
      from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.

      The function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. One of those
      checks confirms that the modulus ('p' parameter) is not too large. Trying to use
      a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which
      is over 10,000 bits in length.

      However the DH_check() function checks numerous aspects of the key or parameters
      that have been supplied. Some of those checks use the supplied modulus value
      even if it has already been found to be too large.

      An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained
      from an untrusted source could be vulernable to a Denial of Service attack.

      The function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions.
      An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected.
      The other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and
      EVP_PKEY_param_check().

      Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications
      when using the '-check' option.

      The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.
      The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.
